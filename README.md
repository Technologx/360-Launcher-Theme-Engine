360-Launcher-Theme-Engine
=========================

This theme engine is currently in development. There are a few buttons that do nothing at the moment. This simple application pushes what is found in the asset folder to the 360Launcher/themes/ folder to allow the launcher to detect the theme that was 
-pushed by this application. What is required in the asset folder to allow the 360launcher to identify the theme is unknown at this time. Putting together a template for users to use at a later date.
